# Titanic Classification Project

This project is a machine learning system designed to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived the sinking. The prediction is based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.



## Key Features

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: Cleaning and preparing the Titanic dataset for analysis.

𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: Selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model accuracy.

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐄𝐃𝐀): Understanding data patterns and correlations through visualization and statistical methods.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: Implementing classification algorithms to predict passenger survival.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Using the trained model to predict survival outcomes for passengers.

𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Creating visual representations of data insights and model predictions.


## Additional Information
